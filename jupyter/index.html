<h2 id="how-jupyter-works">How Jupyter Works</h2>

<div id="summary">
  <p><em>Jupyter notebooks are a framework for sharing interactive computing across a variety of programming languages. They can run on your own machine, or be shared via the web. When used in conjunction with Binder, they become the interface for a web-accessed virtual computing environment.</em></p>

</div>


<p>Interactive notebooks for running and sharing code have been a feature of certain computing languages for some time. The <a href="http://jupyter.org">Jupyter Project</a> emerged out of one such approach for sharing Python work, called &lsquo;ipython&rsquo;. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPython#Project_Jupyter">Wikipedia page</a> (as so often with tech-based things) is quite good on the details.</p>

<p>When one starts a Jupyter notebook on her computer, the environment searches for &lsquo;kernels&rsquo; that tells Jupyter what languages are available. Jupyter understands Julia, Python, and R (hence JU-PYT-R) by default. Other kernels can be installed. It then opens a browser based interface that includes a file manager (showing the files in the directory where we started Jupyter up, for a given session), a terminal window, and the notebook environment itself. When we click on &lsquo;new&rsquo; we can select which kernel - which language - we want the notebook to be written in. Notebooks themselves are composed of &lsquo;blocks&rsquo;. Each block can be either a code block, or a text block (using the conventions of markdown, eg <code>#</code> for headings, <code>+</code> for bullets and so on). Each block can then be run by pressing the play button (a triangle icon) or stopped (the square icon). When a block is running or executing code, an asterisk appears to the left of the block. The results of a block are printed underneath the block. The notebooks may be saved. If they are uploaded to a repository in github, they will display correctly. (They will have the <code>.ipynb</code> file extension).</p>

<p>A Github repository containing Jupyter notebooks can be shared using <a href="https://mybinder.org">Binder</a>. You give the URL to your Github repository to Binder, and Binder will in turn give you a unique URL to a virtual computer preloaded with the bits and pieces that will run your notebooks in a live environment. <strong>NB!</strong> Binder is still in beta, meaning, they&rsquo;re still working out the kinks. A Binder environment will time out after 10 minutes of inactivity.</p>

<p>In ODATE, we link to the Bindered powered versions of our notebooks - even if you&rsquo;re using a tablet, you can still run the code! If you wish to run them on your own machine, download Jupyter and <a href="https://jupyter.org/install.html">get started</a>.</p>
